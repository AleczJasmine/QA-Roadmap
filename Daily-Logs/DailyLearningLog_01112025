Initial Draft (From Chatgpt)

Week 1-2: Core Programming Fundamentals
Goal:
Learn the basics of a programming language commonly used in automation (e.g., Python, Java, or JavaScript).

Topics:
Variables, data types, and operators
Control structures (if-else, loops)
Functions and methods
Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism)
Exercises:
Write simple scripts (e.g., a calculator or a number guessing game).
Implement functions that handle common tasks (e.g., string manipulations, sorting lists).
Resources:
Online tutorials: Python, Java, JavaScript
Practice: HackerRank, LeetCode
Week 3-4: Introduction to Automation Testing
Goal:
Understand the basics of automation testing and set up your first test environment.

Topics:
What is automation testing?
Manual vs. Automation testing: Benefits and challenges
Introduction to testing frameworks: Selenium (for web), Appium (for mobile)
Setting up your development environment
Tools:
Selenium WebDriver (Java/Python)
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code
Browser Drivers: ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver
Exercises:
Write a simple Selenium script to open a webpage and verify its title.
Create a test script to perform login on a sample web application.
Week 5-6: Advanced Selenium Concepts
Goal:
Master Selenium WebDriver for robust web automation.

Topics:
Locators (ID, className, XPath, CSS selectors)
Handling dynamic elements
Working with dropdowns, alerts, and iframes
Implicit and explicit waits
Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
Exercises:
Create a POM-based framework for a simple web application.
Automate a workflow involving form filling, navigation, and validation.
Week 7-8: Test Frameworks and Reporting
Goal:
Learn to use testing frameworks for structuring your tests and generating reports.

Topics:
TestNG / JUnit (for Java) or pytest (for Python)
Assertions and annotations (before/after methods)
Test suites and parallel execution
Generating test reports (using Allure or ExtentReports)
Exercises:
Integrate Selenium with TestNG or pytest.
Create a test suite that runs multiple test cases and generates a detailed report.
Week 9-10: CI/CD and Version Control
Goal:
Automate the test execution process and learn to work with CI/CD tools.

Topics:
Git basics: cloning, branching, committing, merging
Introduction to Jenkins or GitHub Actions for CI/CD
Configuring Jenkins to run your Selenium tests automatically
Test execution on different browsers using Jenkins
Exercises:
Set up a Jenkins pipeline that triggers your test suite on every code commit.
Run automated tests on different environments (local, staging).
Week 11-12: API Testing with Automation
Goal:
Expand your automation skills to cover API testing.

Topics:
Basics of RESTful APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Introduction to Postman for manual API testing
Automating API tests using RestAssured (Java) or requests (Python)
Validating API responses (status codes, headers, and payloads)
Exercises:
Write automated tests for a sample API.
Create an API test suite that verifies key endpoints and handles edge cases.
Week 13+: Enhancements and Real-world Practice
Goal:
Work on advanced topics and real-world projects.

Topics:
BDD with Cucumber
Cross-browser testing with Selenium Grid
Cloud-based testing platforms (e.g., BrowserStack, Sauce Labs)
Writing reusable utility functions and libraries
Projects:
Build a complete automation framework for a demo e-commerce site.
Automate end-to-end tests for a real-world application.
Ongoing: Keep Practicing and Learning
