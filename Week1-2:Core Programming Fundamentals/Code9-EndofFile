The challenge here is to read  lines of input until you reach EOF, then number and print all  lines of content.

Hint: Java's Scanner.hasNext() method is helpful for this problem.

Input Format

Read some unknown  lines of input from stdin(System.in) until you reach EOF; each line of input contains a non-empty String.

Output Format

For each line, print the line number, followed by a single space, and then the line content received as input.

Sample Input

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int lineNumber = 1;
        while (scanner.hasNext()) {  // Continue reading until EOF
            String line = scanner.nextLine();  // Read the next line
            System.out.println(lineNumber + " " + line);  // Print line number and content
            lineNumber++;  // Increment line number
        }
        
        scanner.close();  
    }
}
