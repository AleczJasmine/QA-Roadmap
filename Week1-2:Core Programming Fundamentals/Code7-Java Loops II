The first line contains an integer, q , denoting the number of queries. 
Each line i of the q subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective ai, bi, ni and  values for that query.

Output Format

For each query, print the corresponding series on a new line. Each series must be printed in order as a single line of  space-separated integers.

Problem Explanation:
Input:
The first line contains an integer 𝑞
q — the number of queries.
Each of the next 𝑞 lines contains three integers 
𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑛:
a: The starting value.
b: A value added at each step.
n: The number of terms in the series.

Approach:
Use a loop to process each query.
Generate the sequence for each query using a loop to compute powers of 2 and add the corresponding values.
Print the series in the required format.


import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

class Solution{
    public static void main(String []argh){
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t=in.nextInt();  // first line - number of queries    
        for(int i=0;i<t;i++){
            int a = in.nextInt();   //starting value
            int b = in.nextInt();  // A value added at each step
            int n = in.nextInt();  // Number of terms in the series
            
            int sum = a;
            for(int j = 0; j<n; j++){
                sum+= (int) Math.pow(2,j)*b;
                System.out.print(sum + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
        in.close();
    }
}
